An example of unit testing JS

Getting Started
===============

This project requires Bower for package management which in turn requires Node.js.

Follow these steps to install these tools on your `Linux` command line:

- `sudo apt-get install nodejs`
- `sudo npm install -g bower`

If you don't have `Linux`, you've made a huge mistake, and can follow these steps:

- download a Node.js installer package from [the node.js website](http://nodejs.org/download/)
- run the Node.js installer package
- run `npm install -g bower` on your command line of choice

Once Bower has been installed, you need to ask it to install all of the project's dependencies.
You do this by issuing the command `bower install` in the root directory of the project (where `bower.json` is).

This will install all of the dependencies into the `js/lib` folder.
